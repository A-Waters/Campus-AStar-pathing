This is a project made by Alexander Watermen
This is coded in a language called "Processing" So if you cant open it, thats why.
It was the lanague I had to use for creating this school project in my into to programing class.
It uses A* pathing algorithm to find the quickest way around the campus based on two building selections

Currently Known bugs (which I dont have intent on fixing):
1.Sometimes you cant selcet a new staring location
2.sometimes buildings to doors will be locked off if used already
